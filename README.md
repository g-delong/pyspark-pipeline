# Spark Pipeline


Welcome to Spark Pipeline! This project was generated from a template using [cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/) designed for the Geisinger AI Lab.


## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

You can get started in a Sagemaker notebook terminal by running the following commands:

```bash
# Set up a Python virtual environment
conda create -n spark-pipeline python=3.9
conda activate spark-pipeline
# Install requirements & integrations
make setup
# Initialize zenml project, and
# import and set docker stack
make zen
```

You can now run the pipeline locally: 

```
# Run the pipeline
python run.py
```

Refactor the pipeline and steps, and add logic inside the
`src` directory as needed for your project. 

If a remote zenml server is available, you can connect to the server.

```
zenml connect --url http://ip-address:port --username default --password ""
```

Once connected, you can list available stacks and set the active stack:

```
zenml stack list

zenml stack set {stack_name}
```

For more information on zenml, send a Teams chat message to the GAIL team.
